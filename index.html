                <span>Brazil has been a pivotal part of my journey into Latin American research. As a child, learning
                    about the Amazon River dolphin sparked my interest, despite my fondness for bottlenose dolphins.
                    This led me to delve into international research, starting with these fascinating freshwater
                    creatures. Though I'm Colombian, Brazil has always been my gateway to understanding Latin America, a
                    fact that often surprises others.
                    My understanding of Colombia, however, is clouded by sensational news from Caracol International,
                    family anecdotes, and my own experiences. In contrast, I view Brazil through an academic lens, which
                    also shapes my perception of Latin American politics. Studying figures like Bolsonaro, I'm not
                    surprised by the similarities I see with political figures like Donald Trump, considering their
                    shared approach to governance.
                    As a Catholic Christian, I find myself deeply troubled by the hypocrisy and heresy in some
                    evangelical movements globally. The irony of their stance against 'indoctrination' and 'sex
                    education', while simultaneously practicing their form of religious indoctrination, is stark. This
                    includes early religious practices like infant baptism. Their rejection of sex education and control
                    over children's thoughts create a breeding ground for predators, perpetuating cycles of abuse in
                    ultra-religious communities.
                    In Brazil, a complex web of corruption has emerged, which could be seen as a 'coinfection' of
                    societal ills, exploiting the Brazilian populace. This includes police and military officers
                    dominating the very favelas they were meant to protect. Bolsonaro's government, influenced by the
                    BBB lobbies, has created an environment where organized crime thrives. The relaxation of
                    environmental laws has allowed drug traffickers to expand their operations with minimal resistance,
                    and the influx of firearms has further empowered these criminal elements.
                    Meanwhile, in the United States, some advocates of the Second Amendment cite low murder rates,
                    overlooking the underreporting of crimes and the expansion of criminal syndicates into areas like
                    the Amazon. The police control over favelas only adds to this complex tapestry of unreported
                    violence and crime.

                    there).
                    I have never thought, “This is so frustrating. I should go suck-start an S&W M&P 9 Shield M2.0.”
                    Researching gun violence in America is so infuriating that you may use the expression. “Are you
                    fucking kidding? I want to shoot myself.” To describe the unique frustration researchers face when
                    they look at a governmental database and find that only a corrupt bureaucracy can create a
                    particular kind of weaponized incompetence.
                    With any illicit economy, there are already inconsistencies on a global level between guns that are
                    used illicitly and the records that are kept. But the puppets manipulated by the gun lobby that are
                    Uncle Sam have decided that the one organization solely responsible for federal firearms record
                    keeping must keep through records that include the guns sold in all the closed gun shops in this
                    nation. But they must not be searchable at all. The information on every firearm sold at a
                    closed-down shop in the United States is stored chronologically, where each shop is individually
                    indexed.
                    This is obviously of concern to most people because it wastes the American people's and their civil
                    servants' time and money. However, considering this impact on the reports that the ATF can publish,
                    it is especially concerning. At the end of the year, the ATF compiles statewide reports that are a
                    2nd Amendment, lusting conservative’s dream and focusing on the crime and cities that were
                    associated with firearm recovery. This is the perfect ammunition for these moral entrepreneurs to
                    protect their corporate sponsors when someone wants to talk about how many S&W M&P 9 Shield M2.0 is
                    sold daily, 30 at a time to a junky who is very clearly going to give their newly minted gun
                    collection to whatever criminal underling gave them enough money for exactly 30 S&W M&P 9 Shield
                    M2.0s and an FBI background check. Instead, they can talk about how the majority of guns recovered
                    in NY were from NYC. It’s honestly too bad that the most significant “category” is “Possession of
                    Weapon” and not organized crime like it is. Thankfully, the data from the ATF is valuable enough
                    that every year, the state can point fingers at the source of where external guns are recovered and
                    reported to the ATF. And I can make a map out of this relationship.
                    What this means is that when I want to create artwork targeting the most prominent gun manufacturers
                    in the United States and Brazil, I cannot follow the scientific method I have created for giving
                    each lobbyist their gun. Allow me to explain my madness. I went into this project with a particular
                    delusion that my understanding of research surrounding illicit economies and the deep-seated control
                    corporations have on the US, which predicted exactly my current predicament, could be wrong. Once I
                    started researching, I would magically find data in my efforts to visualize.

                <span>Admittedly, my skills in Photoshop could be better. I just made the images black and white, but I
                    hope my presentation can make up for it. Understanding Bryce's art creation process is critical to
                    emulating it effectively. In the art world, particularly in illegal markets, restorers sometimes
                    turn into forgers, or vice versa, developing their styles so distinctively that their work gains
                    independent value. While I'm not forging Fernando Bryce's work, I am drawing heavy inspiration from
                    his style to highlight the issues he addressed through his art.
                    My approach is grounded in a belief that innovation sometimes requires starting from scratch. This
                    is encapsulated in two philosophies. The first originates from the open-source community, with an
                    unwritten rule to contribute to existing projects rather than always starting anew. Projects may
                    diverge when ideological differences arise, but the foundational principle remains collaboration.
                    The second philosophy is learning by doing. As I emulate Bryce's style, I'm also embracing the
                    essence of his work. Bryce wasn't just an artist but a journalist whose art sensationalized issues,
                    demanding a deeper engagement with the complexities he depicted from viewers.
                    In my work, I've sought to adhere to Bryce's spirit, experimenting with various styles to achieve my
                    desired outcome. Initially, I merged Bryce's original pieces with relevant faces from my research,
                    striving to maintain the black-and-white aesthetic he often employed. This method aligns with how
                    Bryce brought attention to overlooked historical events, like in his 'Archive Studies series on
                    World War I. He brought faces to the names in old newspapers, a technique I've tried to replicate.
                    Johanna Calle is another influence in my work, known for her focus on legislation impacting
                    displaced rural communities. She symbolically used trees in her art, representing new beginnings
                    against the backdrop of historical land sale records. These records not only signify historic
                    ownership but also the forced sales during armed conflicts. This historical coercion resonates in my
                    project, especially in contexts like the favelas under Bolsonaro's regime, where police coercion is
                    rampant.
                    In my piece 'Cara às balas', the tree symbolizes the state's corruption and the potential for new
                    growth if the corruption is eradicated. This duality captures the essence of Bryce and Calle's
                    works, blending historical context with contemporary implications.
